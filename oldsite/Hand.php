<h2>Hand To Rock</h2>

<p>These works were inspired by a moment at Force Crag â€“ a now derelict mine in the English Lake District.  A mud-covered hand instinctively placed on the page of a small sketch book crystallised a wealth of ideas relating to the work of the earliest cave artists, our own ongoing relationship with the earth, and the way we have for thousands of years, used the substance of the earth's crust to 'make our mark'.</p>

<p>The works were recently exhibited at an exhibition of speleological art in Australia.</p>
