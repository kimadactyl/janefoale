<h2>Professional Activities</h2>

<p>Jane Foale's work is concerned with the expressive qualities which she sees as intrinsic to matter, material and process. Specifically, her work relates the making of art to geological substances and events.</p>

<p>Her practice is supported by research and study at Leeds College of Art and Design, the University of Leeds’ Departments of Contemporary Art Practice, Earth Sciences and Colour Chemistry, and at the Colour Museum in Bradford.</p>

<p>Foale’s interest in geology is a very practical one.  She holds a permit to collect minerals in the Caldbeck Fells from the Lake District National Park Authority, and is a member of a number of related professional and special interest organisations.</p>

<h3>Molecules. Minerals. Matter</h3>

<p>A recent project has been a collaboration with Cliffe Castle Museum, in Keighley, West Yorkshire.  Cliffe Castle boasts an outstanding mineral collection and the artist has been given access to their specimens.</p>

<p>The year long residency has culminated in an artist’s intervention within the mineral galleries.  The show will run for six months.  This has created exciting possibilities for inter-disciplinary educational projects and she will be running workshops for Heads of Art in schools and colleges in the area, family days and other events with Museum visitors.</p>

<h3>Winsor &amp; Newton</h3>

<p>The project has been supported by Winsor &amp; Newton who have supplied materials and expertise.  As the work explores analogies between the mineralisation process and pigment behaviour it requires a wide range of high quality, single pigment paints.  Winsor &amp; Newton were therefore a natural partner and their involvement has helped to make this a particularly interesting and rewarding project.</p>

<p>Tom Groundes-Peace, UK Marketing Co-ordinator at Winsor &amp; Newton, comments: 

<blockquote>"At Winsor &amp; Newton we find working with artists is one of the most inspiring parts of our business. We strive to keep up with the latest developments in the art world so when Jane Foale approached us with her project we jumped at the chance to find out more. Jane's exploration of the relationship between paint pigments and geology is both scientifically progressive and artistically inspiring. As an amateur geologist and artist, Jane has successfully brought together the mesmerizing beauty of the minerals found in the natural world with the wonderful and colourful possibilities of paint."</blockquote>
