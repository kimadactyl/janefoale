<h2>Molecules.Minerals.Matter</h2>

<p>Molecules, Minerals, Matter exists within the intersection of several very fertile areas of artistic investigation.</p>

<p>There is much contemporary comment on the increasing interest in the potential of scientific practice and process as areas ripe for investigation and as sources of great inspiration to artists. Jane Foale’s practice holds echoes of a time when artists needed to understand the chemical properties of minerals to grind pigments and mix paints from the rocks themselves; when the definitions of artist and scientist were not polarised as they are in our contemporary understanding.</p>

<p>Foale refers to the properties of the pigments she works with in terms of ‘units of colour’ and also characterises their movement, in solution, across the special substrate she prepares for them as a feature of their organic or inorganic chemical make-up. Her process, developed and repeated in the spirit of artistic curiosity, seems almost to mimic the careful processes of day to day laboratory life and through it she seems to restore to the pigments a sense of the natural aesthetic of the rocks from which they have been derived.</p>

<p>Cliffe Castle Museum in Keighley, where the collections research and resulting intervention have taken place, houses the natural science collections of the Bradford District. In choosing to research as an artist in the museum she has opened up a new avenue of enquiry into, and interpretation for, the natural science collections.</p>

<p>Bradford Museums, Galleries and Heritage continue to invite artists in to work with the collections and develop exhibitions in this way.</p>
