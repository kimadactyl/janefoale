<h1>Jane Foale</h1>

<p>Jane Foaleâ€™s work explores links between art and mineralogy.  She seeks to examine process in her work and to find ways of visually capturing process as a moment in time through her use of materials.</p>

<p>The artist researches and disseminates her work both in the field and through relevant organisations.  This has led to her involvement with a number of residencies and other projects involving museums, schools and other public bodies.</p>
